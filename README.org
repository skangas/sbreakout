This is a small Breakout clone written in C++ using SDL.

I wrote this many years ago, and it's probably not useful as more than an
exercise, but I figured I might as well archive it here.

To build this, you probably need to install these prerequisites (on Debian GNU/Linux):

#+begin_quote
sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
#+end_quote

Then simply type:

#+begin_quote
make
#+end_quote

Information on the copyright and license for the graphics in [[graphics/README]] and
for the music in [[music/README]].  The photo ~background.jpg~ is in the public

I wrote this for fun, but pull requests are welcome.  I probably won't be fixing
any bugs though.

Happy hacking!
